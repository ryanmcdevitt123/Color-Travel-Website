        <p> There is more to The Netherlands than Amsterdam... really! Amsterdam is iconic, but Holland has a lot more to offer. From the flat and green agricultural area in the North and the coastal provinces of Noord-Holland, Zuid-Holland and Zeeland to the flowering hills in the exuberant South. Discover quaint little towns such as the fortified town of Naarden, car-free Giethoorn (the Venice of Holland), the famous mussel fishers of Yerseke or traditional fishing village Urk. The historic city of Haarlem, only a stone throw away from Amsterdam is also a great place to visit.</p>
